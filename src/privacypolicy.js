        Additionally, we collect usage data about how you use our services, such
        as app interactions, preferences, and device information.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
        We use your data to create and manage your user account, analyze and
        understand how our services are used to improve user experience and

        We may share your data with trusted third-party vendors who assist us
        with services such as data hosting, analytics, or customer support. We
        may also disclose your information to comply with legal obligations,
        protect our rights, or prevent fraud. We do not sell your personal data

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Data Retention Policy</h2>
